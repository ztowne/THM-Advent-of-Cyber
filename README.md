# THM-Advent-of-Cyber

Hello! I am currently going through the TryHackMe 2023 Advent of Cyber, which is a fun, gamified way to learn and use industry cybersecurity tools. 
- There is one 'room' a day where I will be presented a variety of challenges and tasks to complete.
- Each day will have a theme applied to it (besides Christmas). For example, one day we might look at digital forensics, yet the next day we might be looking at AI in offensive security.

This is my first year doing this and am excited to document the process!
